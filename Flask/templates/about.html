        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
            This project presents a comprehensive solution for predicting employee productivity in the garment manufacturing industry. It demonstrates a full data science life cycle, beginning with an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the source data.

            A Random Forest Regressor, a powerful ensemble model, was selected and trained using Python's Scikit-learn library to achieve high predictive accuracy. The final, trained model is served through this interactive web interface, which was built using the Flask framework, allowing for real-time predictions based on user-defined inputs.
