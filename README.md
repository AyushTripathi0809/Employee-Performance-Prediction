# Employee-Performance-Prediction
An end-to-end machine learning project to predict employee productivity using a Random Forest model and a web interface built with Flask.
Predictive Analytics for Workforce Performance
This repository contains the complete source code for a machine learning project designed to forecast employee productivity. The application demonstrates a full-stack data science approach, starting with in-depth data exploration and culminating in a live, interactive web application where users can receive real-time predictions.

Project Vision
The core objective of this project is to move beyond historical analysis and provide a forward-looking tool for human resources and operations management. By identifying the key variables that impact employee output, this application serves as a proof-of-concept for how data science can be applied to foster a more efficient and supportive work environment.

Technical Architecture
Data Analysis & Modeling: All data processing, feature engineering, and model training were conducted in a Jupyter Notebook (Training files/Machine Learning.ipynb). The final predictive model is a Random Forest Regressor, chosen for its high accuracy and robustness.

Web Application: The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It handles user requests, processes inputs, and serves the predictions generated by the model.

Frontend Interface: The user interface is built with standard HTML and styled with CSS for a clean and responsive user experience across all devices.

Core Libraries: The project leverages key Python libraries including Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

Getting Started: Running the Application Locally
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your own machine.

1. Initial Setup
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
2. Environment Configuration
This project uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies cleanly.

Bash

# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install Required Packages
Install all necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch the Web Application
The main application script is located inside the Flask directory.

Bash

# Navigate into the application folder
cd Flask

# Run the Python script to start the server
python app.py
5. Access the Project
Once the server is running, open your favorite web browser and navigate to the following address:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
